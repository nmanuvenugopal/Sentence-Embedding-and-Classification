# Sentence-Embedding-and-Classification
Sentence embedding with Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), InferSent, SBERT (Sentence-BERT) and then classifying the embedded input using the same or different transformer model.
**Universal Sentence Encoder (USE)**: Developed by Google. It's available in two versions: USE-Base and USE-Large.

**InferSent**: InferSent is a sentence embedding model developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR). It's trained on natural language inference data and is known for producing semantically meaningful sentence representations.

**SBERT (Sentence-BERT)**: SBERT is an extension of BERT that focuses specifically on sentence embeddings. It fine-tunes BERT for sentence similarity tasks, enabling it to generate embeddings that capture semantic meaning and relationships between sentences.
